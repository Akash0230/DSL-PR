Practical No: 9(D)
Practical Title:  Write C++ program to check well formedness of parenthesis using stack.
Aim: In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to
{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well parenthesized or   not.
	
Pre-requisite:
•	Basics of stack.
•	Different operations that can be performed on stack

Objective:
•	To check whether the given expression is well parenthesized or not.

 Input      : Expresstion using {},(),[].s


Outcome:   Result of checking well formedness of parenthesis.

Theory:
   
-	Write short theory of stack.
-	Write concept of well form parenthesis.
-	Example of well form parenthesis.

Algorithms :
Write your own algorithms

Flowchart :
Draw flowchart for above algorithms.


Conclusion:
By this way, we can check well formedness of parenthesis using stack.
